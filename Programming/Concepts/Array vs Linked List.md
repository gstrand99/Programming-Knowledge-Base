## [[Array]]
- usability is slightly more difficult
- all operations have a  [[Big O]] of O(1)
- better for random access

## [[Linked List]]
- slightly easier to use
- to replace or remove from the middle you must walk all the way though the list so it is slower in that aspect 
- better for popping or inserting from front or end of a list
