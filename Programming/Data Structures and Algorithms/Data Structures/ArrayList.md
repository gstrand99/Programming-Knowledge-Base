## What is it?
- [[Big O]] of an operation 
	- push is constant O(1)
	- pop is also O(1)
	- enqueue, dequeue, delete, insert O(N)
- When you try to push while over capacity
	- create a new array
		- copy all values over to new, larger array and then push to the end of the new array
	- you want to get as little memory as you could need, but not too little to have a bunch of grow operations
- enqueue not great because you must move every item to the right
- dequeue does the same but the other way
- arraylists are very bad with queue like operations but not with push or pop
