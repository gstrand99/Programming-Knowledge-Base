## How does it work
-  a collection of nodes that are linked to the next node 
	-  single linked list (a)->(b)->(c)->(d)->(e)
	- double linked list (a)<->(b)<->(c)<->(d)<->(e)
- deletion and insertion can be very fast
	-  insertion and deletion [[Big O]] is always O(1)
- every single linked list is a graph and tree
